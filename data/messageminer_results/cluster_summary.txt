Cluster Theme:  Uncomfortable or painful experiences with bras, such as straps slipping, underwire causing pain, straps cutting into shoulders, back pain from wide straps, and too much cleavage.
Cluster Size:  76


VERBATIMS FROM CUSTOMERS:


"Awkwardness feeling shamed better sizing"
"The Glamourise sports bras are great because the straps don't slip. I was wearing a racerback bra but these restrict movement in my traps (trapezoid muscles) and but other bras with shoulder straps slip. The Glamourise have the straps at the back more centred and they do not slip. Also, they do not have an underwire (ouch...bloody ouch!) but offer great support. Best sports bras I have ever worn (and I have tried lots)."
"I do not have sore shoulders, or uncomfortable back area"
"It seems there is a little less give in the back."
"They are soft, no padding"
"I dont know maybe you use fabric that is anti itch!!?"
"Straps falling off my shoulder"
"Too much cleavage"
"Cutting into my shoulders. The ones I bought have thicker straps"
"Back pain from wide cushioned straps"
