Having to buy in store. Last time I went for a fitting and asked for a wireless one as I found the under wire dig in. She talked me into an under wire as they are not like they used to be. $70 later and a very uncomfortable wedding as they did dig in. Never wore it again.
I have a real issue buying bras for my daughter who is 14 and a size 10EE. She wants something that is comforts and holds her in but also doesnâ€™t look like she should be 40 and above to wear

Narrow shoulders. I need narrow set back straps or front opening racer back but front opening are difficult to buy online and get the size correct. Not may Australian stores stock many front opening bras but they are very popular in America

"Well Iâ€™ve twice ordered from you. The first time I waited so long for delivery and was finally advised that what I ordered wasnâ€™t available. The second time I ordered I waited and waited, then contacted you and the hurry up resulted in the bra arriving, but it was too small, despite being marked as the exact same size as the one I was wearing (24E). So Iâ€™m returning it and asking for my money back in full,"
